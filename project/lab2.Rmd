# Introduction

In this report, I compare using regression trees and linear models to predict electricity consumption for space heating in U.S. households. The models are based on the Residential Energy Consumptions Survey dataset @recs. The dataset contains responses from \num{12083} households to detailed survey questions regarding their energy consumption and expenditures, as well as their housing situation.
